Governance in a decentralized world plays a big role in defining the roadmaps as well as the direction of the protocol. Big whales with big voting power can incluence the future of the protocol which might not be favorable for small token holder. We combine the power of NFT to voting by giving small stakeholder voters weighted advantage. Small token holders who vote consistently in the winning proposal will be able to unlock new categories of NFTs giving them more voting power. This will give small token holders a chance to compete with big whales in the governance process. âœ…

## Demo

We're live on [https://nft-id.vercel.app/](https://nft-id.vercel.app/)! ðŸŽ‰

## Usage

### Frontend

1. Run `cd app` to change to the frontend subdirectory. The following commands must be run from there.
2. Go to https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 and copy the secret.
3. Create `.env.local` (in `app`!) with the following contents:

```
GITHUB_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
GITHUB_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXX
TWITTER_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXX
TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXX
SECRET=XXXXXXXXXX
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Change the URL on production!
```

(Replace each `XXXXXXXXXX` with a valid value.)

4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the application locally.
6. Go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the app.

P.S. You can deploy the app to Vercel for free by following the instructions [here](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme). (Remember to set the environment variables.)

### Backend

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Install [Solana](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools#macos--linux).
3. Install [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation#anchor).
4. `cd program` to change to the program subdirectory. All the following commands must be run from there!
5. `npm ci && npm ci -D` to install the exact versions of the dependencies.
6. `solana-keygen new --force --outfile wallet.json --no-bip39-passphrase`
7. `anchor build`
8. `solana airdrop 2 wallet.json` (repeat at least 3 times)
9. `anchor deploy`
10. Replace the old program ID (`3mAW7AVHr7TRvYkmeXKdTsDCYjdnJ2t4TpFeXPb57BRu`) in `Anchor.toml` and `lib.rs`.
11. `anchor test`
12. `node printPrivKey.js`
13. Import the private key in Phantom and switch to Devnet. The NFT should be there.
